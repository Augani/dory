narrativeRole: Translate the feature cascade into the user benefit: one coherent native workspace rather than disconnected infrastructure surfaces.

keyMessage: The breadth is delivered through one native, open-source Mac app.

Adapt: keep the blueprint's single outward camera reveal as the signature move, compress it for this fast clarity beat, and use only element-level motion after the camera locks.

Scene 1 (0.00–0.82s): open tight on the completed six-level board from Frame 2; one fast decelerating **zoom-out** (`viewport-change`) reveals that the board lives inside a simplified, faithful Dory native app shell with navy sidebar, warm-white workspace, and the exact fish in the title area. The whole app is authored from frame zero; no second set and no zoom-in.

Scene 2 (0.82–1.72s): camera fully locks. Three visible capability columns magnetically converge into one centered app surface while `ONE NATIVE MAC APP` reveals in two large lines beside it. Asymmetric 60/40 with three depth layers; **cluster→inward assembly** (`center-outward-expansion`, reversed) and **per-word staggered reveal** (`dynamic-content-sequencing`).

Scene 3 (1.72–2.82s): the app surface condenses at the same center into the exact Dory app icon while a green outlined proof capsule wipes on: `FREE + OPEN SOURCE`. The fish remains untouched as a small supporting mark. **Scale-swap** (`scale-swap-transition`) is element-level after the camera lock; the proof uses a left-to-right mask reveal and then holds still for the harness transition.

# Center-Outward Expansion

Elements begin at one shared center point and radiate outward to their final positions — the entry beat itself, or motion driven by another animation's progress (a counting number, a beat). Flat 2D cousin of [depth-scatter-assemble.md](depth-scatter-assemble.md) (per-element 3D cloud): here every element shares the SAME origin.

## How It Works

Each element carries its final offset as `data-target-x/y`. Its position lerps between center and target: `x = targetX × progress`. Self-centering is baked as `xPercent/yPercent: -50` so the tweened `x`/`y` are pure offsets from the stage center. Standalone burst = per-item staggered `fromTo`; driven burst = one shared proxy (see Variations).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="burst-wrap">
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="-360" data-target-y="-180">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="360" data-target-y="-180">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="0" data-target-y="360">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.burst-wrap {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.burst-item {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%; /* GSAP xPercent/yPercent -50 bakes the centering; x/y tween the offset */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
document.querySelectorAll(".burst-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50, x: 0, y: 0, scale: 0.6, opacity: 0 },
    {
      x: Number(el.dataset.targetX),
      y: Number(el.dataset.targetY),
      scale: 1,
      opacity: 1,
      duration: EXPAND_DUR,
      ease: EXPAND_EASE,
    },
    ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Synced to a driver (chord)**: when the burst shadows a counter / beat, drop the stagger and drive all items from ONE 0→1 proxy tween with the driver's exact duration AND ease; `onUpdate` writes `translate(-50%,-50%) translate(targetX*p, targetY*p)` per item — the two read as one beat.
- **Partially-spread start**: with 6+ items the full cluster piles up — start from `{ x: targetX * START_PROGRESS, ... }`.
- **Idle micro-float**: hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) after landing instead of freezing.

| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ITEM_COUNT     | 3–8                  | > 8 = visual chaos mid-expansion; low counts want wider spread   |
| EXPAND_DUR     | 1.0–1.8s             | must equal the driver's duration in the synced variant           |
| EXPAND_EASE    | `power3.out` default | `power2.out` gentler, `expo.out` dramatic stop; NEVER `in` eases |
| STAGGER        | 0.04–0.08s           | tighter = chord; looser = lazy arpeggio                          |
| ENTRY_AT       | 0–0.5s               | a beat of compositional quiet before the burst                   |
| START_PROGRESS | 0–0.5                | 0 = dramatic full cluster; ~0.3 avoids the pile-up               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween `x`/`y` over the baked `xPercent/yPercent: -50`** — mutating `left`/`top` fights the centering and causes pixel jitter.
- **Out-easing only** — `in` easings read as items being sucked back mid-air.
- **No other absolute-positioned siblings inside `.burst-wrap`** — they'd steal the centered baseline.
- **❗ The burst IS the beat** — don't park a "real headline" label below it (the eye snaps to the label and ignores the burst). If a label is needed, reveal it post-burst in the same stack.
- Synced variant: identical duration + ease as the driver, or the chord falls apart.

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Values

| SEC_PER_CHAR  | 0.03–0.06 s/char      | ≈17–33 chars/sec; uniform across the sequence so the pace reads as one engine; lean high for wide-character languages |
| HOLD_MID      | 0.5–1.0s              | dwell on a non-final entry; `< HOLD_FINAL`                                                                            |
| HOLD_FINAL    | 1.0–2.0s              | climax dwell — must exceed HOLD_MID by a clear margin so the close reads as a beat                                    |
| SPEED_FACTOR  | 0.5–2.0 (default 1.0) | per-entry only; if every entry shares a factor, fold it into SEC_PER_CHAR                                             |
| TAIL_PAD      | 0.0–1.0s              | quiet beat after the last entry; prefer 0 when the next composition owns the breath                                   |
| CONTENT N     | 3–6 entries           | <3 isn't a sequence; >6 drags (accelerating cadence relaxes this — see above)                                         |

Reference: `../../examples/messaging-multi-phrase.html`.

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.

# Viewport Change (Virtual Camera)

Simulates camera effects (zoom / pan / focus-lock on a moving element) by transforming a wrapper around ALL scene content. The "world" moves opposite to the perceived camera. Distinct from [multi-phase-camera](multi-phase-camera.md) (2-3 discrete phases + drift) — viewport-change is a single continuous zoom/pan, often used for focus-lock following a moving element.

## How It Works

Camera intent → world transform. Camera **pans right** → world `translateX(-distance)`; camera **zooms in** → world `scale(>1)`; camera **follows element X** → world `translateX(viewportCenter - elementWorldX)` per-frame. Get the sign right or everything moves the wrong way. The single `.world` wrapper holds the camera transform; elements inside are positioned in world space, unchanged.

**Single-element composite transform (this rule's form).** Both scale and translate live on ONE wrapper as `translate(x, y) scale(S)`. CSS applies scale FIRST, then translate (right-to-left matrix composition), so a point at world offset `(ox, oy)` lands on screen at `(S × ox + x, S × oy + y)`. To map the target to viewport center, solve `S × offset + T = 0`:

```
T = -offset × S
```

This is **different from [coordinate-target-zoom](coordinate-target-zoom.md)**, which uses two nested wrappers (outer scales, inner translates) and derives `T = -offset` (independent of S). Mixing up the two forms drifts the target off-center as scale changes. Use this single-wrapper form when you want one source of truth for camera state (`cam.scale`, `cam.x`, `cam.y`) written via `onUpdate`; use nested wrappers when scale and translate can tween independently with shared ease.

## Scale Value Guide

| Effect      | Scale       | Feel                                |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Subtle      | 1.02 - 1.05 | Barely perceptible — "professional" |
| Medium      | 1.05 - 1.15 | "Ta-da" emphasis                    |
| Noticeable  | 1.15 - 1.30 | Focus on region                     |
| Dramatic    | 1.5 - 2.5   | Element fills screen                |
| Full-screen | 3.0+        | Element covers viewport             |

Perception: < 5% scale change is imperceptible; 10-15% is comfortable emphasis; > 30% is cinematic/dramatic. For a natural product feel, prefer 1.05-1.15× over 2-3s; save big > 1.3× zooms for dramatic narrative moments.

### Extreme range — 4–12× outward (workspace reveal)

The same single-cam math runs far past the table: a zoom-out workspace reveal opens punched-in at **4–12×** on one detail (a single cell, message, or button) and pulls out to the full workspace in one continuous move. The mechanics don't change — one `cam` object, `T = -offset × S`, one `applyCamera()` writer — only the authoring direction does:

- **Build the workspace at its final (1×) layout and OPEN scaled-in** (`cam.scale = 8`, counter-translate aiming the opening detail; state it in a `fromTo` / seed via `applyCamera()` so a seek to t=0 lands punched-in). The wide landing frame is then everything at native design size — text crisp, raster assets at source resolution.
- **Never the inverse** — authoring the close-up at 1× and scaling the world down to 0.08–0.25 for the wide frame drops every label below legible pixel size and softens raster media; the reveal lands on mush.
- **Measure the opening target** — at S = 8, a 1 px error in the baked offset is 8 px on screen at the opening pose. Take the offset from the target's real laid-out center (`getBoundingClientRect` after `fonts.ready`, once at setup — the measuring doctrine in [coordinate-target-zoom.md](coordinate-target-zoom.md)), never from a layout formula.
- **The opening detail must survive ×S** — it renders at `S ×` its design size on the first frames (vector/DOM text is safe; raster needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S`).

## Variations

- **Focus-lock (camera follows a moving cursor/character)** — keep the element at a fixed screen X by computing the world offset per-frame inside the driver's `onUpdate`:

```js
const focusEl = document.querySelector(".moving-cursor");
const targetScreenX = VIEWPORT_WIDTH * FOCUS_SCREEN_X_FRAC; // 0.4–0.7; 0.5 = dead center
const focusUpdate = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  focusUpdate,
  {
    p: 1,
    duration: FOLLOW_DUR, // matches how long the focused element is in motion
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const rect = focusEl.getBoundingClientRect();
      cam.x = targetScreenX - (rect.left + rect.width / 2);
      applyCamera();
    },
  },
  FOLLOW_START,
);
```

- **Composite scale (multi-phase)** — two proxy tweens multiplied through one writer: `cam.scale = scaleUp.v * scaleDown.v; applyCamera()`. Combine a slow push-in (~1.15) with a brief release (~0.9) for a breath/punch shape.
- **Camera mode transition (centered → follow)** — crossfade two camera modes via a 0→1 weight tween; intermediate frames interpolate between the modes' offsets.

## Critical Constraints

- **One `.world` wrapper carries the whole camera** — every scene element lives inside it; a second transformed wrapper is a second camera.
- **Single source of truth via the `cam` object + `applyCamera()`** — when scale and translate both change, write them in ONE place; never split them across tweens that touch `world.style.transform` directly (the transform string composition order becomes unpredictable).
- **Single-wrapper counter-translate is `T = -offset × S`** — don't import the nested-wrapper `T = -offset` formula.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`**; **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.world`**; **background on `.scene`, never on `.world`**.
